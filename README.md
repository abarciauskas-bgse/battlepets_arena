This app uses the [dice_bag](https://github.com/mdsol/dice_bag) gem to configure config files (those suffixed with `.dice`). Generate required files with the following commands.

```bash
rake config
```

**Database creation and initialization**

Install PostgreSQL: [How To Setup Ruby on Rails with Postgres](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-ruby-on-rails-with-postgres)

_PostgreSQL was chosen because it is acknowledged to be the most advanced DBMS and offers the most data type flexibility ([source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems)). There is no requirement for advanced data types now, but this means we are not limited to them._

Setup the database:

```bash
$ psql
username=# create role battlepets_arena with createdb login password 'password1';
username=# \d
```

Create the databases and run migrations

```
rake db:create db:migrate
```

**How to run the test suite**

```
rspec spec
```

**Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)**

```
bundle exec sidekiq -q default
```

**Deployment instructions**

None at this time

**Run the app**

```
rails s -p 3001
```
